Catholic Mary was not welcomed in Scotland where the barons controlled government but were themselves
still divided into two camps: Catholic and Protestant. The Protestants were winning the battle for Scots
minds as Scotland was undergoing a sea-change in religion through the efforts of such figures as the Calvinist
minister John Knox (c. 1514-1572). Knox was an influential figure who founded the Presbyterian Church of Scotland
and his views that a woman should not rule, especially one with the 'wrong' religion, were adopted by many others.
